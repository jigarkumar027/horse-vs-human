# horse-vs-human
A fun experiment on convolution neural network to classify the horse and human .

The need of different module and meaning of different argument are given into the notebook step by step.

Here we are making a classifiere which can distinguised between horse and human. To make this classifier we are using the tensorflow framework to make coding easy and tensorflow gives an nice a interaction for the convolution nural network for feature extraction.
